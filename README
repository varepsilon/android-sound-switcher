This application is intended to give you a simple way to switch off
your sound for a particular perioud of time (e.g. lecture or business meeting).


DISCLAIMER: I write this app for my girlfriend who always forgets to
switch her sound back on after the lecture.
You can freely request new features using github issues functionality.
Pull requests are also welcomed.
